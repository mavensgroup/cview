**CView** is a high-performance crystallographic tool written in **Rust** and **GTK4**. It bridges the gap between structure visualization and *ab-initio* calculation setup (VASP, QE, SPRKKR).

```admonish warning title="Performance Limitation: Macromolecules"
This version of `CView` is built on **GTK4**, which primarily utilizes the CPU for rendering.

While the engine is optimized, it is designed for **crystal structures** (unit cells, supercells, slabs). It handles systems up to $\approx 1000$ atoms with ease, but it is **not suitable** for visualizing massive biological macromolecules (e.g., proteins, DNA) containing millions of atoms.
```

```admonish note title="Philosophy"
CView is not just a viewer; it is a **pre-calculation validator**. It focuses on Reciprocal Space and Geometric consistency to prevent wasted CPU hours on incorrect VASP/QE inputs.
